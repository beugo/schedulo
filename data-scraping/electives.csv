This unit focuses on how language is represented in the human brain and how it is realised by the body in speech and sign. It also focuses on how linguistic ability develops in children, how child language acquisition compares to machine learning, and on what differently abled language users can teach us about where language sits in the brain."
Narrative in the Digital Age,ENGL1401,No,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=ENGL1401,Professor Tony Hughes-d'Aeth,"[('lectures', '2 x 1 hour'), ('tutorials', '1 hour per week beginning in week 2)')]",,"This unit examines the complexity of narrative forms in the digital age. It examines narrative technique across a range of traditional and new media including novels, feature films, long-form television series and graphic novels. The unit explores a variety of narrative techniques and important concepts in narrative theory. By analysing a variety of textual forms the unit enables students to explore the proposition that the art of narration is intrinsic to a text's capacity for innovative and imaginative expression."
Spanish Studies 1,SPAN1401,No,"Semester 1, Semester 2",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=SPAN1401,Dr Anna Gadd,"[('interactive lectures', '2 hours per week over 12 weeks'), ('language classes', '2 hours per week over 12 weeks (involving a mix of formal instruction by the tutor, class discussion, group and pair work on linguistic and cultural themes, and oral presentations)'), ('interactive lectures', '9 contact hours per week over 4 weeks')]",,This unit offers an introduction to Spanish grammar and vocabulary to enable students to communicate both orally and in writing in simple situations. It develops cultural and linguistic awareness and focuses on contemporary spoken and written language used in Spain. Students achieve language proficiency equivalent to Level A1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. The unit leads to SPAN1402 Spanish Studies 2.
Introduction to Law,LAWS1104,Yes,"Semester 1, Semester 1",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=LAWS1104,Alvin Yap   and Michelle De Souza,[],,"Topics covered include the Australian legal system; statutory interpretation; the law of torts and professional liability; the law of contracts (elements of a valid contract, vitiating factors, construction of contracts, breach of contract and remedies); and consumer protection law and product liability."
Law for Everyday Lives,LAWS1112,Yes,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=LAWS1112,Aidan Ricciardo    and  Amy Thomasson,[],,"The law affects each and every one of us, although not always in the same way. The vast majority of people are unaware of the many legal issues that can impact on everyday lives.This unit will introduce students to some of the most fundamental legal concepts as well as providing practical guidance in navigating legal issues that can be encountered on a day to day basis. Covering all major aspects of a person's life, such as working, consuming, renting and using the internet, this unit will be particularly useful to those students new to adulthood. The unit will provide an introduction to the law, including the nature and role of law, sources and the court system before moving on to a consideration of  core legal concepts, such as Criminal Law, Torts and Contract. These core concepts will be interspersed with practical topics, examining how these central legal principles may arise in a real world context. These practical topics will include driving, working, housing, medical care, and purchasing goods and services, as well as how to advocate for change in the law."
Bioethics,PHIL2001,Yes,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=PHIL2001,Dr Rob Wilson,"[('lectures', '2 hours per week'), ('tutorials', '1 hour per week')]",,"This unit focuses on a set of related questions concerning life and death such as—Is it rational to fear death? What, if anything, gives human beings a special moral status? Do any other animals have a similar status? Is it morally acceptable to kill them for food? Is euthanasia, the killing of those who are incurably ill and in great pain or distress, for their own sake, morally justified? If so, under what circumstances exactly? What is the moral status of abortion? Students become familiar with some of the most influential works on such questions. As well as learning about such substantive issues, students also deepen their understanding of ethical reasoning in general, and sharpen their ability to understand, evaluate and construct arguments."
"God, Mind and Knowledge",PHIL1003,Yes,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=PHIL1003,Dr Andrew Milne,"[('lectures', '2 hours per week (for 10 weeks)'), ('workshops', '1 hour per week (for 10 weeks)')]",,"This unit covers some fundamental issues which are central in philosophy and which provide an introduction to contemporary philosophical debate. The topics are organised around three major themes—God, Mind and Knowledge. It covers such issues as whether it is reasonable to believe in God, whether we have grounds for believing in the external world, whether the mind and brain are really distinct and what makes us count as the same person over time."
Introduction to Critical Thinking,PHIL1002,Yes,"Semester 1, Summer Teaching Period",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=PHIL1002,Dr Nin Kirkham   (Summer); Dr Miri Albahari   and Dr Nin Kirkham   (S1),"[('lectures and workshops', 'up to 3 hours per week')]",,"The fundamental questions each human being faces are—What should I believe? What should I do? Asking those questions implies that some answers are better than others and the better answers are those supported by better reasons. Answering them requires the ability to distinguish good reasons for believing or doing things from bad ones. In this unit, students acquire the concepts and develop the skills involved in analysing, creating and evaluating arguments for and against beliefs and actions. They learn to apply these skills to real cases from philosophy and other disciplines. Because the ability to think and argue clearly and convincingly is central not just to philosophy but to university studies in general, a wide variety of material is studied, and many students find the unit's content of immense value later on, both within the University and later in employment and their subsequent areas of specialisation."
Understanding Global Politics,POLS1102,No,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=POLS1102,Dr Jie Chen,[],,"This unit enables students to understand the nature of international politics. It looks at the structure of the international system, its evolution, current international political configuration, the role of developing states, and the emergence of various non-state actors in international politics. The ideas of order and justice, and the role of the United Nations, are explored with reference to a range of issues which may include alliances, regionalism, international law, environmental problems, human trafficking, nuclear proliferation, human rights, religion, ethnicity and terrorism. The unit aims to make students familiar with various approaches to the study of international relations and also to give students an appreciation of the complexity of decision making in the current world order. Overall, the unit provides the conceptual and methodological foundations that allows students to begin thinking like an international relations analyst."
Understanding Politics and Policy,POLS1101,No,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=POLS1101,Dr Felix Pal,[],,"Politics is about power. Political science is the systematic study of how humans organise to exercise and contest power. This unit will introduce you to the approaches political scientists use to understand how power operates in modern and contemporary politics. By the end of this unit you will be well-prepared to continue the study of national and international politics - and other social science topics (including sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy, history, business). Most importantly, you will better understand the key actors, and institutions that shape nations, communities, neighbourhoods, families, and your daily life. This unit does not teach you what to think about politics, it gives you the conceptual tools to evaluate and develop your own critical thinking about politics and power."
Aboriginal Encounters: Strangers in our Backyard,INDG1150,No,"Semester 1, Semester 1, Semester 1",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=INDG1150,Melville Thomas,[],,"This unit examines the often contested historical realities of Aboriginal experience in postcolonial Australia. Significant eras in shaping an Australian national identity are deconstructed in order to highlight the cultural, social and political impact on, and from, the Aboriginal nation. The unit also explores how collective historical experiences transmit and transform over time."
Beyond 'Gender Wars',GEND1901,No,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=GEND1901,Dr Jessica Murray,[],,"In these times of twitter hashtags, trolling, no-platforming, and polarised politics, gender can seem like a battleground. This unit is for students who are interested in developing a more nuanced understanding of our contemporary gender order, by examining its links to the past, as well as its links with other markers of identity such as class and race. Topics cover debates about gender in such fields as politics, sexuality, media, human rights and working life, and the history of feminist interventions in these fields is also explored. By introducing students to key concepts in gender theory, qualitative and quantitative evidence of inequality or exclusion and its consequences, and methodologies that support the sensitive navigation of complex social issues, the unit works to enable students as change agents who can pursue an agenda of gender and social equality in every context they live and work."
Crime and Punishment in Britain 1600–1900,HIST3007,No,"Semester 2, Semester 2",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=HIST3007,Associate Professor David Barrie,[],,"This unit draws upon a wide array of primary and secondary sources in order to provide a critical assessment of how crime was perceived, controlled and punished in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has three main aims—firstly, to examine changes in crime and perceptions of crime over this period; secondly, to investigate the manner in which law enforcement and criminal justice systems were reformed in response to changing needs and perceptions; and thirdly, to critically assess the competing theoretical frameworks which have been advanced to explain reform. Key questions to be addressed include—What was the rationale behind Witchcraft? What did contemporaries regard as crime, 'social crime' and 'social protest'? How did the early modern criminal justice system function and in whose interests? Why did prisons and transportation replace public executions as the cornerstone of many penal systems? What historical explanations have been advanced to explain the transition from an unpoliced to a policed society? And how can long-term trends in crime, including class and gender variations, be explained? England forms the main focus of the unit, but comparisons are drawn with other parts of the United Kingdom (not least as Scotland had its own criminal justice system) as well as other countries."
Experimenting with Archaeology,ARCY1002,No,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=ARCY1002,Professor Alistair Paterson,[],,"This unit is both practical and thematic. In the practical component students are trained to use traditional methods to make an artefact selected from a past human culture. Hands-on tutorials teach students about the properties of stone, wood, clay, fibre and other materials that people have used to make artefacts. These artefacts show how people met challenges such as climate change and social unrest by using innovation to shape the world around them. In the thematic component we look at how archaeologists go about their work, examining 'big issues' such as identity and DNA, gender, cross-cultural contact, climate change, human use of symbols, technology and contemporary issues such as homelessness, graffiti and how war affects the world's cultural heritage treasures. We train students in global cultural awareness and appropriate ethical conduct when engaging in cross-cultural research."
Glory and Grandeur: An Introduction to the Ancient World,CLAN1002,Yes,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=CLAN1002,Dr Lara O'Sullivan,"[('lectures', '2 hours per week (for 10 weeks)'), ('tutorials', '1 hour per week (for 8 weeks)')]",,"‘We are all Greeks', so said the poet Shelley. The rich, and occasionally contested, legacies of Ancient Greek and Roman civilisation can be seen around the world, even today, in literature, politics, philosophy, law, religion, art and architecture. Yet who were the Greeks and Romans? What did they achieve in peace and war? Moreover, what things can we learn about Greek and Roman culture from the literary and physical remains of these two ancient civilisations? ‘Glory and Grandeur' provides an introduction to the histories of Ancient Greece and Rome.  It aims to impart knowledge about these ancient civilisations, looking at Greek and Roman politics, warfare, society and culture. It offers a structured program of lectures, which provide a narrative of Greek and Roman history, while also identifying and tracing the development of such major social and political aspects of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations. A complementary series of tutorials and take-home assignments provide students with the opportunity to examine some of these topics in depth. The unit emphasises the collection, analysis and criticism of the ancient source material, and how this material may be used to reconstruct the histories of Greece and Rome. CLAN1002 forms the basis for further study in ancient history as well as providing a useful background for studies in archaeology, history, political science, and philosophy."
"Society, Law and Politics",ANTH2406,No,"Semester 2, Semester 2",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=ANTH2406,Adam Keen,"[('Workshops', '12 x 3 hrs')]",,"This unit examines power, governance, and resistance by introducing anthropological and interdisciplinary approaches to studying society, law, and politics. Students examine various topics and case studies in Australia and internationally to explore the culture of public problems, the politics of influence, and the discursive construction of power relationships. Students in this unit complete a creative worldbuilding team project wherein they create a fictional world and populate its society, culture, governance, and economy with relational, compelling, and exciting structural qualities that, in the end, tell stories about our own world!"
