The emphasis is on choosing and applying appropriate methods, rather than technical details and formal inference. Topics include controlled experiments versus observational studies; different experimental designs—confounding, misinterpretation; biases—blinding and randomisation; and analysis—linear regression, linear models and analysis of variance."
Analysis of Observations,STAT2402,Yes,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=STAT2402,Assistant Professor Nazim Khan,"[('Lectures', '3-hours per week'), ('Computer Labs', '2-hours per week'), ('Workshops', '1-hour per week')]",,"Many real-world problems involve analysing data sets that are not normally distributed. For example, binomial data in the form of presence/absence recordings, Poisson data measured as counts of rare events such as car accidents, Gamma data for measurements of rainfall and Weibull data for the expected lifetimes of machinery. This unit provides experience in analysing such observations. The majority of the unit concentrates on the presentation and analysis of such data sets. Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) are used to incorporate explanatory variables into the analyses. In developing these skills students are trained in an appropriate statistical software package. The unit also provides a rudimentary understanding of probability and statistics necessary for applying the likelihood theory for estimating these models."

Ethics for the Digital Age: An Introduction to Moral Philosophy,PHIL1001,Yes,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=PHIL1001,Assistant Professor Michael Rubin,[],,"This unit provides an introduction to moral philosophy, and considers its application to problems arising out of the development of new, digital technologies. The first half of the unit covers several influential theories about what makes an action or policy morally right or morally wrong: the divine command theory, moral relativism, utilitarianism, two aspects of Immanuel Kant's deontological ethical theory, and virtue ethics. In the second half of the unit, applied ethical questions concerning cutting-edge digital technologies are discussed. In the near future, for example, autonomous vehicles will be routinely confronted with the need to make life-or-death decisions. What values should we ‘programme in' to such machines, and how should we decide? Is it possible for a machine to reason morally? How should we manage the risks inherent in the development of new technology? Is there a legitimate role for artificial intelligence in the law? Might sufficiently developed forms of artificial intelligence be said to have a form of consciousness, and might this have implications for how they ought to be treated?"

Overall, the unit provides the conceptual and methodological foundations that allows students to begin thinking like an international relations analyst."
Understanding Politics and Policy,POLS1101,No,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=POLS1101,Dr Felix Pal,[],,"Politics is about power. Political science is the systematic study of how humans organise to exercise and contest power. This unit will introduce you to the approaches political scientists use to understand how power operates in modern and contemporary politics. By the end of this unit you will be well-prepared to continue the study of national and international politics - and other social science topics (including sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy, history, business). Most importantly, you will better understand the key actors, and institutions that shape nations, communities, neighbourhoods, families, and your daily life. This unit does not teach you what to think about politics, it gives you the conceptual tools to evaluate and develop your own critical thinking about politics and power."
Aboriginal Encounters: Strangers in our Backyard,INDG1150,No,"Semester 1, Semester 1, Semester 1",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=INDG1150,Melville Thomas,[],,"This unit examines the often contested historical realities of Aboriginal experience in postcolonial Australia. Significant eras in shaping an Australian national identity are deconstructed in order to highlight the cultural, social and political impact on, and from, the Aboriginal nation. The unit also explores how collective historical experiences transmit and transform over time."
Beyond 'Gender Wars',GEND1901,No,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=GEND1901,Dr Jessica Murray,[],,"In these times of twitter hashtags, trolling, no-platforming, and polarised politics, gender can seem like a battleground. This unit is for students who are interested in developing a more nuanced understanding of our contemporary gender order, by examining its links to the past, as well as its links with other markers of identity such as class and race. Topics cover debates about gender in such fields as politics, sexuality, media, human rights and working life, and the history of feminist interventions in these fields is also explored. By introducing students to key concepts in gender theory, qualitative and quantitative evidence of inequality or exclusion and its consequences, and methodologies that support the sensitive navigation of complex social issues, the unit works to enable students as change agents who can pursue an agenda of gender and social equality in every context they live and work."
Crime and Punishment in Britain 1600–1900,HIST3007,No,"Semester 2, Semester 2",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=HIST3007,Associate Professor David Barrie,[],,"This unit draws upon a wide array of primary and secondary sources in order to provide a critical assessment of how crime was perceived, controlled and punished in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has three main aims—firstly, to examine changes in crime and perceptions of crime over this period; secondly, to investigate the manner in which law enforcement and criminal justice systems were reformed in response to changing needs and perceptions; and thirdly, to critically assess the competing theoretical frameworks which have been advanced to explain reform. Key questions to be addressed include—What was the rationale behind Witchcraft? What did contemporaries regard as crime, 'social crime' and 'social protest'? How did the early modern criminal justice system function and in whose interests? Why did prisons and transportation replace public executions as the cornerstone of many penal systems? What historical explanations have been advanced to explain the transition from an unpoliced to a policed society? And how can long-term trends in crime, including class and gender variations, be explained? England forms the main focus of the unit, but comparisons are drawn with other parts of the United Kingdom (not least as Scotland had its own criminal justice system) as well as other countries."
Experimenting with Archaeology,ARCY1002,No,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=ARCY1002,Professor Alistair Paterson,[],,"This unit is both practical and thematic. In the practical component students are trained to use traditional methods to make an artefact selected from a past human culture. Hands-on tutorials teach students about the properties of stone, wood, clay, fibre and other materials that people have used to make artefacts. These artefacts show how people met challenges such as climate change and social unrest by using innovation to shape the world around them. In the thematic component we look at how archaeologists go about their work, examining 'big issues' such as identity and DNA, gender, cross-cultural contact, climate change, human use of symbols, technology and contemporary issues such as homelessness, graffiti and how war affects the world's cultural heritage treasures. We train students in global cultural awareness and appropriate ethical conduct when engaging in cross-cultural research."
Glory and Grandeur: An Introduction to the Ancient World,CLAN1002,Yes,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=CLAN1002,Dr Lara O'Sullivan,"[('lectures', '2 hours per week (for 10 weeks)'), ('tutorials', '1 hour per week (for 8 weeks)')]",,"‘We are all Greeks', so said the poet Shelley. The rich, and occasionally contested, legacies of Ancient Greek and Roman civilisation can be seen around the world, even today, in literature, politics, philosophy, law, religion, art and architecture. Yet who were the Greeks and Romans? What did they achieve in peace and war? Moreover, what things can we learn about Greek and Roman culture from the literary and physical remains of these two ancient civilisations? ‘Glory and Grandeur' provides an introduction to the histories of Ancient Greece and Rome.  It aims to impart knowledge about these ancient civilisations, looking at Greek and Roman politics, warfare, society and culture. It offers a structured program of lectures, which provide a narrative of Greek and Roman history, while also identifying and tracing the development of such major social and political aspects of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations. A complementary series of tutorials and take-home assignments provide students with the opportunity to examine some of these topics in depth. The unit emphasises the collection, analysis and criticism of the ancient source material, and how this material may be used to reconstruct the histories of Greece and Rome. CLAN1002 forms the basis for further study in ancient history as well as providing a useful background for studies in archaeology, history, political science, and philosophy."
"Society, Law and Politics",ANTH2406,No,"Semester 2, Semester 2",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=ANTH2406,Adam Keen,"[('Workshops', '12 x 3 hrs')]",,"This unit examines power, governance, and resistance by introducing anthropological and interdisciplinary approaches to studying society, law, and politics. Students examine various topics and case studies in Australia and internationally to explore the culture of public problems, the politics of influence, and the discursive construction of power relationships. Students in this unit complete a creative worldbuilding team project wherein they create a fictional world and populate its society, culture, governance, and economy with relational, compelling, and exciting structural qualities that, in the end, tell stories about our own world!"
