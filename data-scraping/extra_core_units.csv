Analysis of Experiments,STAT2401,Yes,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=STAT2401,Dr Michael Bertolacci,"[('lectures', '2 hours per week'), ('labs', '2 hours per week')]",Mathematics Applications ATAR or MATH1720 Mathematics Fundamentals or MATX1720 Mathematics Fundamentals or equivalent or Enrolment in 62530 Master of Data Science,"This unit introduces the principles of randomised experiments and practical quantitative tools for analysing the data from such experiments. The emphasis is on choosing and applying appropriate methods, rather than technical details and formal inference. Topics include controlled experiments versus observational studies; different experimental designs—confounding, misinterpretation; biases—blinding and randomisation; and analysis—linear regression, linear models and analysis of variance."
Analysis of Observations,STAT2402,Yes,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=STAT2402,Assistant Professor Nazim Khan,"[('Lectures', '3-hours per week'), ('Computer Labs', '2-hours per week'), ('Workshops', '1-hour per week')]",Mathematics Applications ATAR or MATH1720 Mathematics Fundamentals or MATX1720 Mathematics Fundamentals or equivalent or Enrolment in 62530 Master of Data Science,"Many real-world problems involve analysing data sets that are not normally distributed. For example, binomial data in the form of presence/absence recordings, Poisson data measured as counts of rare events such as car accidents, Gamma data for measurements of rainfall and Weibull data for the expected lifetimes of machinery. This unit provides experience in analysing such observations. The majority of the unit concentrates on the presentation and analysis of such data sets. Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) are used to incorporate explanatory variables into the analyses. In developing these skills students are trained in an appropriate statistical software package. The unit also provides a rudimentary understanding of probability and statistics necessary for applying the likelihood theory for estimating these models."
Introduction to Bayesian Computing and Statistics,STAT3405,Yes,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=STAT3405,Associate Professor Berwin Turlach,"[('Lectures', '2-hours per week'), ('Computer Labs', '2-hours per week')]",Course  Enrolment in the MJD-DATSC Data Science major or the MJD-QTMTD Quantitative Methods major and STAT2401 Analysis of Experiments and STAT2402 Analysis of Observations or STAT2062 Fundamentals of Probability with Applications,"This unit introduces fundamental concepts of Bayesian statistics and illustrates how to apply them to various areas of scientific research.  Probabilistic programming languages (WinBugs, JAGS and/or Stan) are introduced, and their interfaces to the statistical computing and graphics environment R are discussed. These languages are used, either directly or via their R interface, to fit statistical models within a Bayesian framework to real-world examples from many disciplines such as engineering, science (e.g. agricultural, biological, environmental, medical and physical), social sciences, economics, finance and astronomy."
Statistical Learning,STAT3064,Yes,Semester 2,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=STAT3064,Dr KD Dang,"[('Lectures', '2-hours per week'), ('Laboratory', '2-hours per week')]",Enrolment in MJD-CDSDM Computing and Data Science or MJD-MTHST Mathematics and Statistics or MJD-DATSC Data Science or MJD-HSDEM Human Sciences and Data Analytics and STAT2401 Analysis of Experiments and STAT2402 Analysis of Observations or STAT2062 Fundamentals of Probability with Applications or STAT2063 Probabilistic Methods and their Applications,"This unit introduces fundamental concepts and contemporary methods of Statistical Learning – both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches,  and shows how to apply these methods to different data science domains (e.g. physical sciences, medical and biological sciences, engineering, business and social sciences).  Focus will be on the interaction between methods and data, on learning to choose suitable methods of data analysis for particular data and on interpreting the results. Statistical computing (including R and/or Matlab) will form an essential part of this unit."
Statistics for Science,STAT1400,Yes,"Semester 1, Semester 2",https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=STAT1400,Associate Professor Adriano Polpo,"[('Lectures', '3-hours per week'), ('Laboratories', '2-hours per week')]",Mathematics Applications ATAR or MATH1720 Mathematics Fundamentals or MATX1720 Mathematics Fundamentals or equivalent,"This unit provides a solid foundation in statistical methods for students in the sciences (e.g. agricultural, biological, environmental, medical and physical) and social sciences. It covers the principles and applications of statistical reasoning, the use of a statistical software package, and applications of statistical methods. The unit may be taken as part of a major in Applied Statistics. Topics include data exploration and display, modelling univariate data, multivariate data; probability concepts and probability distributions; inference, including point estimation, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing; design of experiments; chi-squared tests, contingency tables; linear regression; and analysis of variance. A widely used statistical package is employed for calculations."
Ethics for the Digital Age: An Introduction to Moral Philosophy,PHIL1001,Yes,Semester 1,https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=PHIL1001,Assistant Professor Michael Rubin,[],,"This unit provides an introduction to moral philosophy, and considers its application to problems arising out of the development of new, digital technologies. The first half of the unit covers several influential theories about what makes an action or policy morally right or morally wrong: the divine command theory, moral relativism, utilitarianism, two aspects of Immanuel Kant's deontological ethical theory, and virtue ethics. In the second half of the unit, applied ethical questions concerning cutting-edge digital technologies are discussed. In the near future, for example, autonomous vehicles will be routinely confronted with the need to make life-or-death decisions. What values should we ‘programme in' to such machines, and how should we decide? Is it possible for a machine to reason morally? How should we manage the risks inherent in the development of new technology? Is there a legitimate role for artificial intelligence in the law? Might sufficiently developed forms of artificial intelligence be said to have a form of consciousness, and might this have implications for how they ought to be treated?"
